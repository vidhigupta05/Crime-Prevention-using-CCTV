## ðŸ”­ &nbsp; About this Project
In this project, we aim to develop a **real-time crime detection technology** that can be integrated with any security system, to ensure public safety through **visual crowd surveillance**.<br>
We have devised a complete software solution for safety and surveillance where we convert these CCTVs from an evidence collection to a crime prevention and detection tool to ensure safety and security.<br> This real-time crime detection technology is integrated with security systems and Desktop Application to get push-in notifications in case any suspicious activity is discovered.
The system will detect and simultaneously alert any violent activity captured by the camera. <br>The technologies encompasses domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning models like **CNN, R-CNN, LSTM**. The dataset consists of 500+ videos scraped off internet and categorized into ***violent and non-violent*** activities.
